This python script I worked up to strip the videos out of a youtube mix.

Example Youtube URL Needed:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHyCRE5pesI&list=RD02al9-3mW6zw8
If you visit the above URL you'll notice there is a ordered list elment with all the
videos in the Mix. This needs to exist in the url inorder for this to work

Use:

python down_mix.py URL

NOTE! if your running this in Linux you can't just copy and paste the URL you have to escape the '&'
I Plan to change this in the future but for now just add the \ in front to escape...

pip install youtube-dl
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
apt-get install ffmpeg
